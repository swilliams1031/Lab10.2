# Lab11.2

I did not need to clone this repository because I had already set it up in GitHub Desktop and published it to my online/upstream github account.

For lab 10.2 I set it up with descriptive file names for the JavaScript and CSS files.

JS file name:  JSlab102.js
CSS file name:  CSSlab10.2.css

I am going to clone this repo to the directory:  C:\Users\Williams521\Documents\GIS_CLASS_FILES\GIS205\Lab11.2
